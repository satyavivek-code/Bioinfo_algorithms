# **Sequence Alignment Algorithms: Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman**
This repository contains implementations of two fundamental bioinformatics algorithms, Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman, used for sequence alignment. These algorithms are foundational in the field of bioinformatics and are instrumental in comparing genetic sequences such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.

# **Overview**
**Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm:** A global alignment technique used for aligning DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. This algorithm aligns the entire length of the sequences from beginning to end, optimizing for the best possible match across the entire length. It's particularly useful for sequences of approximately equal lengths and where the alignment is suspected to span the entire length of the sequences.

**Smith-Waterman Algorithm:** An algorithm used for local sequence alignment. Unlike the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, Smith-Waterman focuses on identifying regions of high similarity within long sequences that might differ substantially in length. This approach is particularly useful for identifying functional domains within genes or proteins.

# **Repository Contents
**1. **Needleman-Wunsch Implementation (nw.ipynb):** This Jupyter notebook contains a Python implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The notebook includes a step-by-step guide for initializing matrices, calculating scores, and performing traceback to achieve global alignment.

2. **Smith-Waterman Implementation (sw.ipynb):** This Jupyter notebook provides a Python implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm. It illustrates the process of initializing a scoring matrix, populating it according to the Smith-Waterman rules, and then tracing back to find the optimal local alignment.

# **Usage**
To use these implementations:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in an environment that supports Jupyter (like JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook).
3. Run the cells in each notebook to see how the algorithms work on sample sequences. You can modify the sequences or parameters as needed for your specific use case.

   
# **Dependencies**
1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy (for matrix operations)
3. Jupyter (for running the notebooks)
